              Itâ€™s an acronym for Automated Robot for Fire Extinguishing In
              Compact Areas Onboard This robot is especially designed for fire
              extinguishing on ships. This robot can extinguish different types
              of fire. It has two fire suppression mediums, that are Water based
              and CO2 based. It can move freely in compact areas like engine
              rooms. It's wirelessly controlled with live video feed. It is
              highly customisable according to different engine room
              specifications.
