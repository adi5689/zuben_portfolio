              As the world is shifting towards renewable energy to overcome the
              ever-increasing demand for energy, solar energy is the best bet we
              have in the current scenario. There are many solar installations
              that we can see but most of those installations are very big.
              However, this work proposes a compact and modular setup that can
              be used as a plug-and-play device. The module is highly
              customizable according to the consumerâ€™s demand.
